Files to create a Debian package.

Build with

: debuild -us -uc

Files are created one directory up.

_status_: the .deb builds and works  (yay!), but we have one issue and
one best practice to fix left.

We have one error at the end:

#+begin_quote
dpkg-genbuildinfo: error: badly formed line in files list file, line 2
#+end_quote
