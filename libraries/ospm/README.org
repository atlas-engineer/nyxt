OSPM: An "Operating System Pacakage Manager".

Inspired by https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages.

Supported package managers:

- [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix]]

It provides an =os-package= class with subclsses which specialize for various
package managers.

If the package manager supports it, the class also includes the list of
dependencies and dependents.

Multiple package managers may coexist.  For instance, Guix can be installed on
top over another OS which also features another package manager.

The library provides functions to interact with packages:

- =list-packages=: The list of all packages.

- =install=

- =uninstall=

- =list-files=

- =find-os-packages=

The following is mostly for functional package managers like Nix and Guix:

- =list-package-outputs=

- =list-profiles=

- =list-manifests=

- =install-manifests=

- =list-generations=

- =delete-generations=

- =switch-generation=

More helpers may be available depending on the package manager.
