RULES is a list of CL-CSS rules (with one level of nesting removed). There are
special symbols that this macro will substitute for theme elements, if
encountered. See `with-theme' for a list of those.

Any non-atomic s-expression put as value of CSS property will be
evaluated too, so you can put arbitrarily complex expressions as
property values.

Example: color all the paragraph text in accent color if the theme is dark, and
in secondary color otherwise. Use the text color as background color. Make
headings have border of tertiary color.
