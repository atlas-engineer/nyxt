BLOCKS is a list of LASS blocks.

Any LASS-friendly syntax (including quasi-quotes) works, so you can evaluate
arbitrary code before the blocks are compiled to CSS. For the convenience of
quasi-quoted forms, this macro let-binds the set of symbols/slots for THEME
around the BLOCKS.

Example: color all the paragraph text in accent color if the theme is dark, and
in secondary color otherwise. Use the text color as background color. Make
headings have border of secondary color.
