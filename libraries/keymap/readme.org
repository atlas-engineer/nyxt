General-purpose keymap management.

This keymap library is inspired by [[https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/emacsy][Emacsy]] (=keymap.scm=) which is inspired by
Emacs.

Goals:

- Support dead keys.
- Customize fallback function when binding is not found.
- Provide a self-insert function.
- Support prefix keys to other keymaps.  For instance, if you prefix my-mode-map
  with =C-c=, then all bindings for my-mode will be accessible after pressing =C-c=.
- List all bindings matching a given prefix.  (Also known as =which-key= in Emacs.)
- List the bindings associated to a command.

Changes compared to Emacsy:

- Modifiers are customizable.  For instance =control= and =meta= can be swapped.
- Support multiple inheritance.
- Support keycode.
- Validate keyspec at compile time.
- Support multiple scheme to make it easy to switch between, say, Emacs-style
  and VI-style bindings.  This orthogonality to keymaps composes better than
  having multiple keymaps: changing scheme applies to the entire program, which
  is easier than looping through all keymaps to change them.
- Translate keyspecs as a fallback.  For instance if =shift-a= is not bound, check =A=.

This library does not deal with global or local bindings: it's up to the calling
application to manage the locallity of their keymaps.
