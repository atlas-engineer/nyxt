This prompter library is heavily inspired by Emacs' minibuffer and [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]].

It only deals with the backend side of things, it does not handle any display.

Non-exhaustive list of features:

- Asynchronous suggestion computation.
- Multiple sources.
- Multiple return actions.
- Customizable matching and sorting.
- Multiple attributes to match and display (also known as "multiple column
  display" like =helm-find-files=).
- Customizable initialization and cleanup functions.
- Notifications sent when suggestion list is updated.
- Per-source history.
- Resumable prompters.
- Selection actions (automatically run persistent actions on selection change).
- Automatically return the prompt when narrowed down to a single suggestion.
