It provides an =os-package= with children which specialize for various package managers.

If the package manager supports it, the class also includes the list of
dependencies and dependents.

The library also provides functions to interact with packages:

- =list-packages=: The list of all packages.

- =install=

- =uninstall=

- =list-files=

- =size=

More helpers may be available depending on the package manager.
