OSPAMA: An "Operating System PAcakage MAnager".

Inspired by https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages.

Supported package managers:

- [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix]]

It provides an =os-package= with children which specialize for various package managers.

If the package manager supports it, the class also includes the list of
dependencies and dependents.

Multiple package managers may coexist.  For instance, Guix can be installed on
top over another OS which runs some other package manager.

The library also provides functions to interact with packages:

- =list-packages=: The list of all packages.

- =install=

- =uninstall=

- =list-files=

- =list-profiles=: Mostly for functional package managers like Nix and Guix.

- =list-package-outputs=: Mostly for functional package managers like Nix and Guix.

More helpers may be available depending on the package manager.
