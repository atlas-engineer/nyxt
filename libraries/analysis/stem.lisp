;; The Porter Stemming Algorithm, somewhat mechanically hand translated to Common Lisp by
;; Steven M. Haflich smh@franz.com Feb 2002.  Most of the inline comments refer to the
;; original C code.  At the time of this translation the code passes the associated Porter
;; test files.  See the function test at the end of this file.

;; This port is intended to be portable ANSI Common Lisp.  However, it has only been
;; compiled and tested with Allegro Common Lisp.  This code is offered in the hope it will
;; be useful, but with no warranty of correctness, suitability, usability, or anything
;; else.  The C implementation from which this code was derived was not reentrant, relying
;; on global variables.  This implementation corrects that.  It is intended that a word to
;; be stemmed will be in a string with fill-pointer, as this is a natural result when
;; parsing user input, web scraping, whatever.  If not, a string with fill-pointer is
;; created, but this is an efficiency hit and is here intended only for lightweight use or
;; testing.  Using some resource mechanism on these strings would be a useful improvement,
;; whether here or in the calling code.

;; Postscript: When I contacted Martin Porter about this anachronism, he decided to fix
;; the C version to implement proper reentrancy.  The CL version is now also served from
;; his central site.  It should be functionally identical to this one, modulo the current
;; comment and a couple harmless formatting and comment changes.

;; This is the Porter stemming algorithm, coded up in ANSI C by the
;; author. It may be regarded as canonical, in that it follows the
;; algorithm presented in

;; Porter, 1980, An algorithm for suffix stripping, Program, Vol. 14,
;; no. 3, pp 130-137,

;; only differing from it at the points maked --DEPARTURE-- below.

;; See also http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer

;; The algorithm as described in the paper could be exactly replicated
;; by adjusting the points of DEPARTURE, but this is barely necessary,
;; because (a) the points of DEPARTURE are definitely improvements, and
;; (b) no encoding of the Porter stemmer I have seen is anything like
;; as exact as this version, even with the points of DEPARTURE!

;; You can compile it on Unix with 'gcc -O3 -o stem stem.c' after which
;; 'stem' takes a list of inputs and sends the stemmed equivalent to
;; stdout.

;; The algorithm as encoded here is particularly fast.

;; Release 1

;; The main part of the stemming algorithm starts here. b is a buffer
;; holding a word to be stemmed. The letters are in b[k0], b[k0+1] ...
;; ending at b[k]. In fact k0 = 0 in this demo program. k is readjusted
;; downwards as the stemming progresses. Zero termination is not in fact
;; used in the algorithm.

;; Note that only lower case sequences are stemmed. Forcing to lower case
;; should be done before stem(...) is called.

;; cons(i) is TRUE <=> b[i] is a consonant.
