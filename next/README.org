* Developer Installation
nEXT browser is built with ECL and EQL, and is designed to be cross
platform compatible. To download a prebuilt-binary, please see the
"Releases" section of this repository.

** OSX Instructions
*** Installing Xcode Command Line Tools
Before installing anything, install the Xcode Comand line tools. To
install the Xcode Command Line tools on OSX execute the following in a
terminal:

~xcode-select --install~

To verify that the command tools were successfully installed type:

~xcode-select -p~

the output of this command should be the path at which the command
line tools are installed.

*** Installing QT5 (Cross Platform GUI Toolkit)
QT5 is available from a number of sources, the easiest is to install
it via a package manager such as Macports or Brew. However you
install, ensure that you install it with webkit support.

You can install QT5 via Macports with the following command:

~port install qt5~

You can also install QT5 via the official qt installer:

https://www.qt.io/download/

To test your installation/version of QT, execute ~qmake --version~.

*** Installing ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp)
Compilable tarballs can be found on the ECL website:

https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/static/files/release/

To verify your installation of ECL:

- Execute ~/usr/local/bin/ecl~, it should show an ECL Prompt
- Verify the contents of ~/usr/local/lib~ contain the ecl libraries.
- Verify the contents of ~/usr/local/include/ecl~ contain the header files

*** Installing Quicklisp
The official quicklisp website can provide updated links
to downloads, and instructions:

https://www.quicklisp.org

To install quicklisp:

- Download https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
- Execute ~ecl --load quicklisp.lisp~ to load quicklisp
- Evaluate in the REPL ~(quicklisp-quickstart:install)~ to install
- Evalute in the REPL ~(ql:add-to-init-file)~ to add quicklisp to your ecl init file

more detailed instructions and other resources are readily available
on the quicklisp website.

*** Installing EQL5 Library & Executable (Embedded QT Lisp)
The source for EQL5 is available here:

https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5

To build and install the EQL Library/Executable:

1. Clone the Repository into a directory where you plan to keep the
   installation, this cannot be moved after installation.
2. In ~src/~ exec: ~ecl -shell make.lisp~ This command generates
   ~src/libini_eql5.a~.
3. Edit ~src/eql5.pro~ commenting out all QT modules you do not
   require.

   - The webkit module is required for nEXT.

4. In ~src/~ exec: ~qmake eql5.pro~. This command generates
   the makefile.
5. In ~src/~ exec: ~make~
6. In ~src/~ exec: ~sudo make install~

To test your installation exec ~eql5 -qgui~, you should presented
with a REPL and a GUI.

After the installation, the following should be completed:

- ~/usr/local/bin~ contains an ~eql5~ executable
- ~/usr/local/include~ contains a folder named ~eql5~
- ~/usr/local/lib~ contains all built QT modules (selected in
  ~src/eql5.pro~) and libeql \*.dylib files

** Linux Instructions
Due to the large variances in Linux distributions: file locations,
package managers, and best practices, this installation guide attempts
to make as few decisions as possible- instead opting to list the
requirements necessary to build nEXT.

*** Installing a compiler
Install a C/C++ Compiler
*** Installing QT5
Install QT directly from QT: [[https://www.qt.io/download/][download QT]], or install via
third party package manager sources, apt-get etc.
*** Installing ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp)
Compilable tarballs can be found on the ECL website: [[https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/static/files/release/][download ECL]]
*** Installing Quicklisp
The official quicklisp website can provide updated links
to downloads, and instructions:

To install quicklisp:

- Download https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
- Execute ~ecl --load quicklisp.lisp~ to load quicklisp
- Evaluate in the REPL ~(quicklisp-quickstart:install)~ to install
- Evalute in the REPL ~(ql:add-to-init-file)~ to add quicklisp to your ecl init file

more detailed instructions and other resources are readily available
on the quicklisp website.

After the installation, the following should be completed:

- ~/usr/local/bin~ contains an ~eql5~ executable
- ~/usr/local/include~ contains a folder named ~eql5~
- ~/usr/local/lib~ contains all built QT modules (selected in
  ~src/eql5.pro~) and libeql \*.dylib files

** Running nEXT
From the directory ~next/~ execute the following command to run:

1. ~eql5 run~

You should be presented with a QT Window. To test that everything
is working execute the following commands:

1. ~C-l~
2. A minibuffer should pop-up in which you can enter text

From the terminal that you launched nEXT you'll be able to see output
from the program. You can additionally create a REPL during runtime
in the following way: ~eql5 run -qgui~.

If an exception or crash occurs, you'll be presented with a REPL that
you can use to debug the program.

** Compiling nEXT (under active development)
*** OSX Instructions
From the directory ~next/~ execute the following commands to compile:

1. ~eql5 make~

Now you should have a compiled next.app, simply execute this app to
start nEXT browser.
* Release Timeline
Major releases are issued by incrementing the first digit. That is,
release 1.20, and 2.20 are one major release away from each other. Minor
releases are issued by incrementing by 0.01. That is, 1.01, and 1.02 are
two minor releases following major release 1.0.

This version describes the minimum usability as a basic browser, with
the following features:

- Implementation of document-mode, the major-mode that all modes extend
- Ability to set key bindings for major modes
- Ability to browse and change buffers using C-x b

*** Definitions
Buffer: All documents are contained in an object type called a
buffer. As an example, a document on the web located at
http://www.url.com can be contained in a buffer with a similar name. A
buffer is composed of all elements (text, bitmaps, etc) necessary to
render a single document.

Mode-map: A keyboard hot-key to function mapping.

Minibuffer: A special buffer dedicated to interacting with nEXT
commands in progress. This buffer appears at the bottom of the screen
and is collapsed when not in use.

Major-mode: A major mode is defined as the primary mode of interacting
with a particular buffer. A mode defines a set of key bindings, hooks
for actions, and presentation details for a given view. At any given
time, there may only be one major mode for a buffer. All major modes
are composed of entirely lower case alpha with dashes used as a
separator. Every major mode has a keyboard mapping that follows this
pattern: document-mode, will have a mode map called document-mode-map.

Minor-mode: A minor mode is a secondary mode of modifying a buffer's
behavior and content. There can be an infinite amount of minor modes
applied to a given buffer. All minor modes are composed of entirely
lower case alpha with dashes used as a separator.

*** DONE Major mode: document-mode
CLOSED: [2017-08-28 Mon 00:29]
All major modes inherit from document mode. Document mode provides the
basic framework for mapping global commands and defining general
behavior.

Document-mode will be the basic major mode for opening documents on
the web. document-mode will extend document-mode, and thus will
inherit all of its key bindings. If there is a conflict of key
bindings, the lowest scope key binding will be prioritized. As a
concrete example, all bindings defined in a minor mode will override
any defined in document-mode. In the first release, document-mode will
support the following key bindings and features:

For the first release, document-mode must have:

**** DONE Ability to open a new html document with the key binding C-l
CLOSED: [2017-08-14 Mon 11:31]
Opening of new pages in the same buffer can be invoked by the key
binding C-l. This key binding will open up the Minibuffer and prompt
the user to enter the url which they would like to visit.
**** DONE Ability to open new buffers with the key-binding M-l
CLOSED: [2017-08-28 Mon 00:28]
Opening of new buffers by invoking M-l will open the Minibuffer.
Within the Minibuffer, the user will be presented with a prompt in
which they can enter in the url they would like to visit in a new
buffer.

- May possibly switch implementation to "hide" rather than "close"
  widgets, possibly using a widget pool as well for memory performance

*** DONE Ability to set Key bindings
CLOSED: [2017-08-12 Sat 16:34]
The following syntax should be used to set a key binding:

(define-key x-mode-map (kbd "C-h") 'function)

    Where x-mode-map is a keymap relating to a mode (major or minor).

    Where 'function is a function that is passed to define-key to
    trigger a function upon a key press.

(kbd "C-h") defines that the keyboard sequence Control + h is
represented. For the keyboard syntax, the following keys are
described:

- S = super key (windows/command key)
- C = control key
- M = meta key (alt key)

A chain of key bindings may be set in the following manner:

(kbd "C-x C-s") will denote the following key presses, Ctrl + x, followed
by Ctrl + s immediately thereafter.

Upon the definition of a "chained" keyboard binding, any elements
in the chain may not be used individually. For example, binding
"C-x C-s", will prohibit the binding of "C-x" by itself. This is
because there would be ambiguity in regards to which key binding
is intended to be invoked. 

*** DONE Ability to browse and change buffers
CLOSED: [2017-09-05 Tue 00:58]
The user will be able to invoke the key binding C-x b to bring up
a menu in the Minibuffer in which they will be able to select a new buffer
to bring to focus.
**** DONE Minibuffer Completion
CLOSED: [2017-09-10 Sun 01:42]
Switch buffer should demonstrate an example of minibuffer completion
candidates
*** DONE Compilation OSX
CLOSED: [2017-09-04 Mon 00:09]
- One "click" build system for deployment on OSX
- Organization of build systems into lisp files, no shell scripts
