;; We need a `command' class for multiple reasons:
;; - Identify commands uniquely (although being a member of `*command-list*' is enough).
;;
;; - Customize minibuffer display value with `object-string'.
;;
;; - Access-time: This is useful to sort command by the time they were last
;;   called.  The only way to do this is to persist the command instances.
