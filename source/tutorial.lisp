   (:h3 "Buffers")
   (:p "Nyxt uses the concept of buffers instead of tabs. Unlike tabs, buffers
are fully separated, each buffer having its own behavior and settings.")
   (:h3 "Modes")
   (:p "Each buffer has its own list of modes, ordered by priority.  A mode is a
set of functions, hooks, keybindings and other facilities that may modify the
behavior of a buffer.  For example, 'blocker-mode' can be used for domain-based
adblocking while 'no-script-mode' disables JavaScript.")
   (:p "Each buffer has separate instances of modes, which means that altering
the settings of a mode in a buffer does not impact other buffers.  Mode specific
functions/commands are only available when a mode is enabled for the current
buffer.")
   (:p "Each mode has an associated " (:i "mode toggler") " which is a command
of the same name that toggles the mode for the current buffer.")

   (:h3 "Prompt buffer")
   (:p "The prompt buffer is a menu that will appear when a command requests user
input. For example, when invoking the " (:code "set-url") " command, you must
supply the URL you would like to navigate to.  The prompt buffer can provide
suggestions.  The list of suggestions will automatically narrow down to those
matching your input as you type.")
   (:ul
    (:li  (command-markup 'nyxt/prompt-buffer-mode:return-selection

          ": Query the user for an action to run over the selected suggestion(s)."))
   (:p " Some commands support multiple selections, for
instance " (:code "delete-buffer") " can delete all selected buffers at once.
When the input is changed and the suggestions are re-filtered, the selection is
not altered even if the marked elements don't show.")
   (:p "When at least one suggestion is marked, only the marked suggestions are processed
upon return.  The suggestion under the cursor is not processed if not marked.")

   (:h3 "Message area")

window) where Nyxt outputs messages back to you. To view the history of all
messages, invoke the command " (:code "list-messages") ".")

   (:h3 "Status area")
   (:p "The status area is where information about the state of that buffer is
printed (typically at the bottom of a window). By default, this includes the
active modes, the URL, and the title of the current buffer.")

   (:h3 "Setting the URL")
   (:p "When ambiguous URLs are inputted, Nyxt will attempt the best guess it
can. If you do not supply a protocol in a URL, HTTPS will be assumed. To
visit a site supporting only the less secure HTTP, you must explicitly type the
full URL including the 'http://' prefix.")

   (:p "You can also view a full tree of the history for a given buffer by
invoking the command 'buffer-history-tree'.")
   (:h3 "Searching")
   (:p "Nyxt can search a single buffer or multiple buffers at the same time.")
   (:p "You can view suggestions for search results in the prompt buffer in one
place rather than having to jump around in a buffer (or multiple buffers).")

renderer. For instance, using the default binding of Nyxt (" (:code "web-cua-map") ") the
key-binding " (:code "C-i") " executes " (:code "autofill") ". Suppose
a user is using their email client which also uses " (:code "C-i") " for the italic command. Thus, after
executing " (:code "application-mode") " the " (:code "C-i") " binding is associated
with the webpage's italic command instead of " (:code "autofill") ". Finally, the
user can return to their configuration just by executing " (:code "application-mode") " again.")
   (:h3 "Enable, disable, and toggle multiple modes")
   (:p "The command " (:code "enable-mode") " allows the user to apply multiple
modes (such as " (:code "nosound-mode") " and " (:code "dark-mode") ") to
multiple buffers at once. Conversely, it is possible to revert this action by
executing "(:code "disable-mode") " while choosing exactly the same buffers and
modes previously selected. Finally, " (:code "toggle-mode") " also allows
activation and deactivation of multiple modes, but only for the current
buffer.")
