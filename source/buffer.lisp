- If it's a file, prefix the query with 'file://'.
- If it's a search engine shortcut, include it in the suggestions.
- If it's none of the above, use the `default-search-engine'.

It runs in two passes.  The first pass does not check the DNS for domain
validity, nor does it return any search engine suggestions.  This guarantees
that a good-enough default suggestion is showed instantaneously.
(We really want this prompter source to be fast!)  The second pass checks the
DNS to precisely validate domains and returns the search engines suggestions, if
any.")
