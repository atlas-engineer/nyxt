;;; We don't use CL-prevalence to serialize / deserialize bookmarks for a couple for reasons:
;;; - It's too verbose, e.g. a list is
;;; (:SEQUENCE 3 :CLASS CL:LIST :SIZE 2 :ELEMENTS ( "bar" "baz" ) )
;;;
;;; - We lack control on the linebreaks.
;;;
;;; - It needs IDs for every object, which makes it hard for the user to
;;;   hand-edit the file without breaking it.
;;;
;;; - Un-explicitly-set class slots are exported if they have an initform;
;;;   removing the initform forces us to put lots of (slot-boundp ...).
