    (:p "Nyxt is written in the Common Lisp programming language which offers a
great perk: everything in the browser can be customized by the user, even while
it's running!")
    (:p "The following section assumes that you know some basic Common Lisp or a
similar programming language.")
    (:p "Nyxt configuration can be persisted in the user
file " (:code (expand-path *init-file-path*)) " (create the parent folders if
necessary).")
    (:p "Example:")
    (:pre (:code "
\(define-configuration buffer
  ((default-modes (append '(noscript-mode) %slot-default))))"))
    (:p "The above turns on the 'noscript-mode' (disables JavaScript) by default for
every buffer.")
    (:p "The " (:code "define-configuration") " macro can be used to customize
the slots of the classes like the browser, buffers, windows, etc.  Refer to the
class and slot documentation for the individual details.")
    (:p "To find out about all modes known to Nyxt,
run " (:code "describe-command") " and type 'mode' to list them all.")

    (:h3 "Keybinding configuration")
    (:p "Nyxt supports multiple " (:i "bindings schemes") " such as CUA (the default), Emacs or VI.  Changing scheme is as simple as running the corresponding mode, e.g. "
        (:code "emacs-mode") ".  To make the change persistent across sessions,
add the following to your configuration:")
    (:ul

everything.  By default, it has only very few bindings like the one
for " (:code "execute-command") ".  You can use it to set keys globally:")

    (:p "A more flexible way is to create your own mode with your custom
keybindings.  When this mode is added first to the buffer mode list, its keys
have priorities over the other modes key bindings.")

typed functions.  Each hook has a dedicated handler constructor.")
    (:p

the " (:code "combination") " slot of the hook.  This combination is a function
of the handlers.  Depending on the combination, a hook can run the handlers
either in parallel, or in order until one fails, or even " (:i "compose")
