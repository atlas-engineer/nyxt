great perk: everything in the browser can be customized by the user, even while
it's running!")

    our web page: "
        (:a :href "https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/learn-lisp" "Learn Lisp")
        ". It contains numerous pointers to other resources, including
        free books both for beginners and seasoned programmers.")
    (:p "Nyxt provides a mechanism for new users unfamiliar with Lisp to
customize Nyxt. Start by invoking the commands " (:code "describe-class") "
or " (:code "describe-slot") ".  You can press the button marked 'Configure' to
change the value of a setting. The settings will be applied immediately and
saved for future sessions. Please note that these settings will not alter
existing object instances.")

    (:p "Nyxt configuration can be persisted in the user
file " (:code (expand-path *init-file-path*)) " (create the parent folders if
necessary).")
    (:p "Example:")
    (:pre (:code "
\(define-configuration buffer
  ((default-modes (append '(no-script-mode) %slot-default%))))"))
    (:p "The above turns on the 'no-script-mode' (disables JavaScript) by default for
every buffer.")

the slots of classes like the browser, buffers, windows, etc.  Refer to the
class and slot documentation for the individual details.")

run " (:code "describe-command") " and type 'mode'.")

    (:h3 "Slot configuration")
    (:p "Slots store values that can be either accessed (get) or changed
(set). Setting new values for slots allows many possibilities of customization.
For instance, keyboard layouts vary across the world. The slot " (:code

    (:p "This will make link-hinting more comfortable for this user. In
addition, other similar approaches of customization can be applied to slots
such as " (:code "spell-check-language") ", which can be expanded to do the
spelling-check of other languages besides English.")
    (:h3 "Web buffers and internal buffers")
    (:p "A `internal-buffer' is used for Nyxt-specific, internal pages such as the
tutorial and the description pages.  A `web-buffer' is used for web pages.  Both
the `web-buffer' and the `internal-buffer' classes inherit from the `buffer'
class.")
    (:p "You can configure a `buffer' slot and it will cascade down as a new
default for both the `internal-buffer' and `web-buffer' classes- unless this slot
is specialized by these child classes.")

    (:h3 "Keybinding configuration")
    (:p "Nyxt supports multiple " (:i "bindings schemes") " such as CUA (the
    default), Emacs or vi.  Changing scheme is as simple as running the
    corresponding mode, e.g. "
        (:code "emacs-mode") ".  To make the change persistent across sessions,
add the following to your configuration:")

        ".  Also see the " (:code "scheme-name") " class and the "
        (:code "define-scheme") " macro.")
     (:p "To extend the bindings of a specific mode, you can extend the mode with "
         (:code "define-configuration") " and extend its binding scheme with "

    (:p "The " (:code "nothing") " command is useful to override bindings to do
nothing. Note that it's possible to bind any command, including those of
disabled modes that are not listed in " (:code "execute-command") ".")
    (:p "In addition, a more flexible approach is to create your own mode with
your custom keybindings.  When this mode is added first to the buffer mode list,
its keybindings have priorities over the other modes.
Note that this kind of global keymaps also have priority over regular character
insertion, so you should probably not bind anything without modifiers in such a
keymap.")
