(defmacro define-mode (name direct-superclasses &body body)
  "Define mode NAME.
When DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES is T, then the mode has no parents.
Otherwise, the mode's parents are ROOT-MODE and DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES.

As a third argument, a documentation-string can be provided.
The last argument (third if no doc-string provided, fourth if one is)
is the direct-slots list.

A mode toggler command is also defined as NAME.
Its arguments are passed to the class instantiation.
Two key arguments have a special meaning beside the slot value of the mode:
- :BUFFER is used to enable or disable the mode in the corresponding buffer.
  This should always be specified in Lisp code since the active buffer, if any,
  might not be the right buffer.
- :ACTIVATE is used to choose whether to enable or disable the mode.
If :ACTIVATE is omitted, the mode is toggled.
The buffer is returned so that mode toggles can be chained.

Example:

\(define-mode my-mode ()
  \"Dummy mode for the custom key bindings in `*my-keymap*'.\"
  ((keymap-schemes (keymap:make-scheme
                    scheme:emacs *my-keymap*
