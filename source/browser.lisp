TEST should be function of one argument, the requested URL.
ACTION can be either a shell command as a string, or a function taking a URL as argument.
In case ACTION returns nil (always the case for shell command), URL request is aborted.
The new URL returned by ACTION is loaded otherwise.

`match-host', `match-scheme', `match-domain' and `match-file-extension'
can be used to create TEST-functions, but any other function of one argument
would fit the TEST slot as well.

- Forward DOI links to the doi.org website.
- Open magnet links with Transmission.
- Open local files (file:// URIs) with Emacs.
