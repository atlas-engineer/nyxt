Use at your own risk -- it can break websites whose certificates are not known
and websites that still don't have HTTPS version (shame on them!).

To permanently bypass the \"Unacceptable TLS Certificate\" error:
\(setf nyxt/certificate-exception-mode:*default-certificate-exceptions*

\(define-configuration web-buffer
