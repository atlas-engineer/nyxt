(define-mode tts-mode ()
  "A mode for interacting with Text-to-Speech (TTS) software.

By default, no executable is configured, so for the mode to work, you need to
configure an executable that can take a string of text. Something like `espeak`
or `espeak-ng` should work out of the box. The content that will be sent to the
executable is the text content of paragraph and heading tags on the page. This
can be configured by changing the `selector` slot.

Example:

\(define-configuration nyxt/tts-mode:tts-mode
   ((nyxt/tts-mode:executable \"espeak\")
    (nyxt/tts-mode:selector \"p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\")))"
  ((visible-in-status-p nil)
   (executable nil
               :type (or string null)
               :documentation "The executable command to run.")
   (selector "p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6"
       :type string
     :documentation "CSS selector that describes which elements' text to speak.")
   (executable-process-info nil
                            :type (or uiop/launch-program::process-info null)
                            :documentation "Holds the process-info object of the running process")))
