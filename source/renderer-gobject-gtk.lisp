;;;;
;;;; This is necessary to modify the behavior of renderer-gtk to use
;;;; gobject to launch/manage the main GTK thread. When/if this
;;;; renderer will fully utilize gobject introspection (by taking the
;;;; changes made on the respectively named branch, and reapplying
;;;; them), then these errors will disappear, as there will be no
;;;; reliance on renderer-gtk (and thus, no redefinition).
