* Basics
** Navigation
Within a tab, all navigation is possible using only the keyboard. To
navigate up and down on a web page, the following keybindings are
provided.

1. ~C-n~: Move down
2. ~C-p~: Move up
3. ~scroll-left~: Move left (no keybindings for now)
4. ~scroll-right~: Move right (no keybindings for now)
5. ~M->~: Jump to bottom of page
6. ~M-<~: Jump to top of page

** Zooming page
Use the zoom keybindings to make everything on a web page larger or smaller.
These keybindings mimic the Emacs counterpart:

1. ~C-x C-=~: Increase size
2. ~C-x C--~: Decrease size
3. ~C-x C-0~: Restore defaults

** Jumping to links (link-hints)
In order to visit a link, one never has to remove their fingers from
the keyboard. It works like this:

1. Enter in a special key combination ~C-g~
2. Several strings will appear on screen "AZ" "CY", these
   special strings represent links that you can visit
3. Enter in one of these strings into the minibuffer
4. Press ~Return~
5. Visit the page

The full key-bindings for link-hint based navigate are found below:

1. ~C-g~: Go to link in current tab
2. ~M-g~: Create new tab with link, focus on new tab
3. ~C-u M-g~: Create new tab with link, keep focus on current tab

** Visiting URLs
When ambiguous URLs are inputted, Next will attempt the best guess
about what the user wishes. If the user does not supply a protocol in
a URL, ~https~ will be assumed. To visit a site supporting only
~http~, the user must explicitly type the full URL with ~http~
included.

1. ~C-l~: Change URL of current document
2. ~M-l~: New document-mode tab

** Searching via search engine
To search via search engine, within the the new URL prompt, simply
enter "s your search query". In the previous example, a search engine
would query "your search query".

Therefore, the complete steps to searching are ~C-l~ or ~M-l~, then,
when the prompt appears, enter "s <search terms>".

** Jumping to Headings
Jumping to different headings based on fuzzy completion is available
via the following keybindings:

1. ~C-.~: Jump to heading

** Input (Minibuffer)
All input is handled within a special area called the minibuffer. The
minibuffer will appear at the bottom of the screen when the user is
responsible for inputting some value. The minibuffer may also suggest
completions.

Any time a function activates the minibuffer there are two applicable
returns:

1. ~C-RET~: Return Immediate - Return EXACTLY what has been typed into
   the minibuffer, ignoring completions.
2. ~RET~: Return Complete - If completion function provided, return
   the selected completion candidate. If completion not provided
   return the EXACT text inputted into the minibuffer. If completion
   function provided, no completion applicable (selected), and the
   :empty-complete is a truthy value, the function will accept the
   EXACT text inputted into the minibuffer.

Below is a concrete example that may help clarify the usage of ~RET~

#+NAME: input-complete-empty
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(:input-complete *minibuffer* set-url-new-buffer
history-typed-complete :empty-complete t)
#+END_SRC

In the above case ~set-url-new-buffer~ will attempt to be completed by
~history-typed-complete~. If there are no suitable candidates, e.g.
the user is attempting to visit a URL they have never visited before,
~:empty-complete t~ will allow the ~return-input~ to return the literal
input to ~set-url-new-buffer~.

** Tabs (Buffers)
Tabs are represented by a concept known as "buffers". Buffers are
known in other GUIs as Views. Unlike in other GUI systems, the
controller for a view can dynamically change. Given a buffer composed
of a web-view and a document-mode model, one can dynamically set the
controller to any other mode. This enables run-time specialization and
modification of widget behavior.

The standard keybindings for tab management (within document-mode)
are:

1. ~C-x b~: Switch tab
2. ~C-x k~: Kill tab
3. ~M-l~: New document-mode tab
4. ~C-l~: Change URL of current document
5. ~C-t~: Make new empty buffer

*** Switching Tabs by Order
In addition to switching tabs by selecting the current tab, you can
cycle through them. This enables you to jump back and forth between
two tabs that are next to each other.

1. ~C-[~: Switch tab previous
2. ~C-]~: Switch tab next

** Searching
There are a number of keybindings provided to enable searching within
a buffer.

1. ~C-s s~: Search for a Given Term: This command will place a red box
   next to every match on a given web-page.
2. ~C-s n~: Next match: This command will move the next match
   to the top of the browser screen.
3. ~C-s p~: Previous match: This command will move the previous match
   to the top of the browser screen.
4. ~C-s k~: Clear Search: Remove the read search boxes from the screen.

** History
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

In the example below, the User performs the following actions:

1. Starts page ~Athens~
2. Visits page ~Ancient Greek~
3. Returns to page ~Athens~
4. Visits page ~Classical Athens~
5. Returns to page ~Athens~
6. Executes ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would NOT be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Ancient Greek~. Instead of
erasing your history, Next offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Ancient Greek~ or to
~Classical Athens~?

The standard keybindings for forward-backward navigation are:

1. ~C-f~: Navigate Forward
2. ~C-b~: Navigate Backward
3. ~M-f~: Navigate Forward Tree
4. ~M-b~: Navigate Backward

By using navigate forward tree you will be prompted for which branch
you'd like to visit as in the example above. The simple navigate
forward command will simply visit the first child of the current node
in the tree.

** Bookmarks
Bookmarks are located in a database located in
=~/.local/share/next/bookmark.db=. This directory and database will be created
automatically for you. The bookmark database is a SQLITE database that
contains one table with two columns: id, url. In order to navigate
and manage your bookmarks, a few functions are provided:

1. ~C-m k~: Delete Bookmark
2. ~C-m o~: Open Bookmark
3. ~C-m s~: Bookmark Current Page
4. ~C-m u~: Bookmark URL (input URL via minibuffer)
5. ~C-m g~: Bookmark Anchor (input URL via link hints)

** Clearing the Echo Area
In the area at the bottom of the screen where the minibuffer resides,
Next will occasionally display messages. These can be dismissed by
using the binding ~C-x q~.

** Exiting
To exit Next enter the key-combination ~C-x C-c~ and the program will
quit. All of your open tabs and form data will not be persisted. The
only information saved will be your filled in passwords, cookies,
and other information within your cache.

* Advanced Topics
** Execute Extended Command
You can execute any command by name by typing =M-x= or =ESCAPE
x=. This will bring up a list of candidates that you can fuzzily
complete.

** Help
The help system allows you to look up variable and function docstrings
directly within Next. Docstrings will appear in a new help buffer.

1. ~C-h v~: Look up a variable docstring
2. ~C-h c~: Look up a command docstring

** Slime with a compiled version of Next
Slime provides a way of interacting with Next, and with Lisp code in
general (in a REPL like manner).

From the Slime Manual:
#+begin_quote
SLIME extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Common
Lisp. The features are centered around slime-mode, an Emacs minor-mode
that complements the standard lisp-mode. While lisp-mode supports
editing Lisp source files, slime-mode adds support for interacting
with a running Common Lisp process for compilation, debugging,
documentation lookup, and so on.
#+end_quote

To use Slime with a compiled version of Next launch a Swank server in
Next with the keybinding ~C-h s~ or ~M-x start-swank~.

Slime can connect to the Swank server and give you completion,
debugging, documentation, etc. The default port for Swank on Next is
~4006~ to avoid collisions with the default Swank port of ~4005~
within an Emacs ~*inferior-lisp*~ process.

After launching the Swank server in Next- within Emacs execute:

1. ~M-x~
2. ~slime-connect~
3. Enter ~127.0.0.1~ for the host
4. Enter ~4006~ for the port (Next variable ~*swank-port*~)

To customize the port that Swank starts on, edit the global variable
~*swank-port*~ in your init file.

* Customization
All customization begins by creating a =~/.config/next/init.lisp=
file.  Within your init file you can write your own keybindings and
customizations. If the directory =~/.config/next/= does not already
exist, you will have to make it.

The first line of an init file should contain the following package
declaration in order to modify Next specific variables and functions:

#+NAME: package
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(in-package :next)
#+END_SRC

Following the package declaration, you can write or override any
functions and variables.

** Keybinding
Keys are defined with the following syntax:

#+NAME: define key
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define-key *global-map* (key "C-x o") #'function-example)
#+END_SRC

in the previous example, the sequence of keys: ~control+x~, lift hands
off control key, ~o~ would invoke the "function-example". Additionally
important to note is that the key sequence ~control+x~ is now
registered as a special type keybinding, a prefix. A prefix key can,
but should not be mapped. If a subsequent mapping was to bind
~control+x~, it would be unclear to Next what keybinding invocation
the user is trying to type.

The following keys exist as special keys:

1. ~C~: Control
2. ~S~: Super (Windows key, Command Key)
3. ~M~: Meta (Alt key, Option Key)

** Loading Files
To load a file again, or reload an init file use the function
load-file. Within the minibuffer prompt enter the full path to the
file you wish to load.

1. ~C-o~: Load File

A convenience function for reloading the init file called
~reload-init~ can also be keybound.

** Creating your own interactive commands
Creating your own invokable commands is the same as creating any other
~defun~ except the form is ~define-command~. A docstring is highly
recommended and will produce a style warning when it is missing.

An example of a trivial command definition can be seen below.

#+NAME: bookmark-url
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define-command bookmark-url ()
  "Allow the user to bookmark a URL via minibuffer input."
  (with-result (url (read-from-minibuffer *minibuffer*))
    (%bookmark-url url)))
#+END_SRC

** Getting input from the user
Getting input from the user via the minibuffer is an asynchronous
command. That is why the ~read-from-minibuffer~ function is wrapped
within a continuation passing style macro ~with-result~. The form
therefore takes the following look:

#+NAME: read-from-minibuffer-example
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-result (variable-name-to-bind-minibuffer-input
              (read-from-minibuffer  *minibuffer*))
  (print variable-name-to-bind-minibuffer-input))
#+END_SRC
