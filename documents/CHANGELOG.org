#+TODO: TASK | DONE

* Release Timeline

Next uses [[https://semver.org/][Semantic Versioning]].  In short, given a version number
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we increment the:
- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

** TASK 1.4.0 (Upcoming)
*** Smart searching across all tabs
+ You should be able to search all tabs simultaneously and see a list
  of completion candidates in the minibuffer
*** Jump to heading across all tabs
+ Add a jump to heading command that works across all open tabs
*** Package manager
+ There should be a package manager/repository where creators of
  packages can publish, and users can download
+ This technology will probably be built ontop of Quicklisp
*** Per tab isolation
+ Add support for per-tab Proxy and Tor support
*** Improve macOS performance
+ Rewrite the Qt port from Python to C++ to improve performance,
  additionally enabling a host of features not offered by the Python
  port
+ Fix some issues with strange keys emitted on macOS from the keyboard
*** Improve macOS distribution
+ Create a standalone application bundle that macOS users can simply
  double click and run
*** ECL, CCL, and EQL compatibility
+ Broaden support for different Lisp implementations by removing SBCL
  specific code when possible
*** Password manager
+ Add an integrated password manager
*** Add built-in editor
+ Add simple built-in editor capabilities so that you can easily
  script Next without opening up an external editor
+ Also use the editor for text-field input on the internet
*** Add support for external editor
+ Allow Next to call out to an external editor to fill in the contents
  of a particular text field
*** Extend bookmark support
+ Switch from SQLite to an s-exp based text file.
+ Bookmarks can have tags, a shortcut string, a timestamp.
+ Bookmarks and search engines can be merged.
+ Proposed format:
  #+begin_src
  (:url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" :title "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" :shortcut "wiki" :search "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s" :time "Sat Jul 14 09:41:56 2018" :tags '("encyclopedia" "knowledge" "wiki"))
  #+end_src
  Minibuffer usage:
  - =wiki=: Open the main page.
  - =wiki elephant=: search Wikipedia for "elephant".
+ Support user-defined filters to avoid duplicating bookmarks.
  For instance detect duplicates =http://foo= and =https://foo=.
+ Support user-define read/write hooks so that bookmarks can be automatically
  imported, say, from Firefox, or exported to a SQLite database or a custom text
  format.

** TASK 1.3.3
- Move the ~search-engines~ slot from the ~window~ class to the
  ~remote-interface~ class.
- Rename ~new-buffer~, ~new-window~ and ~make-visible-new-buffer~ to
  ~make-buffer~, ~make-window~ and ~make-buffer-focus~.

** DONE 1.3.2
- Hooks for commands, modes and various UI or networking events.

  Hooks are lists which the user can fill with /handlers/ to perform arbitrary
  actions on specific events, such as after the creation of a buffer, on
  start/exit, when a download has finished, before/after the execution of any
  command, or when enabling/disabling a mode.

  *Note:* Hooks are still experimental and their API is likely to change in the future.

- New ~open-file~ command (=C-x C-f=).

  This new command allows to open a file from the file system.

  The user is prompted with the minibuffer, files are browsable with the fuzzy completion.

  The default directory is the one from the download manager.

  Press =Enter= to  visit a file, =M-Left= or =C-l=  to go one directory
  up, =M-Right= or =C-j= to browse the directory at point.

  By default, it uses the =xdg-open=  command. The user can override the
  =next:*open-file-function*= variable  with a new function,  which takes the
  filename  (or directory  name) as  parameter.  See the  manual for  an
  example.

  The default keybinding is =C-x C-f=.

  *Note:* This feature is experimental and is meant to grow in future versions
  of Next!

- New ~paste-from-ring~ command. (Thanks to Solomon Block.)

  All copied text snippets are saved in a clipboard "ring."  Any snippet can be
  fuzzy-searched and pasted later.

- New ~minibuffer-history~ command (=M-p=).

  This allows to fuzzy-search the history of minibuffer inputs.  Some minibuffers
  may use their own history, otherwise they use the default.  For instance, the
  ~set-url-*~ history includes the current URL, so that pressing =C-l M-p RET=
  brings up the current URL in the input, ready for editing.

- Improve minibuffer performance when loading many candidates.

- Fix minibuffer scrolling to feel more natural.

- Reduce minibuffer height when there is no completion function (e.g. link hints).

- Add ~next-init-time~ command.

** DONE 1.3.1
*** Print page title in buffer list
And the title is matched when fuzzy-searching a buffer!
*** Improved minibuffer performance: it now shows up instantly
*** Open external links in new buffer by default
This can be configured by setting =(open-external-link-in-new-window-p
*interface*)= to the desired boolean.
*** Return to last created buffer when deleting buffer
When killing  the last  created buffer,  we were  brought back  to the
first one, so usually  the help buffer. This is now  fixed, we stay at
the previous last created buffer, as expected.

*** Minibuffer =M-backspace= improvements
- In  the minibuffer,  using  =M-backspace= to  delete  a word  didn't
  respect whitespaces. It is fixed.
- Its behaviour was  also too different than other  common tools, like
  Firefox.  Now:
  - it deletes the trailing word delimiter;
  - it removes all trailing delimiters /plus/ one word.
*** Add more key bindings
- Keypad keys were added.
  The PyQt port requires an update.
*** Next is back to the Guix official channel
The Next Guix channel can be safely removed from your
=~/.config/guix/channels.scm= before running a =guix pull=.
- Mouse =button2= (middle click) opens a URL in a new buffer/window.
*** Automatically fall back to a local dbus session if none can be used
*** Fix platform port log file path on Guix
It is now properly set to =~/.local/share/next/next-gtk-webkit.log= by default.
*** Fix ignored search engine prefix in minibuffer input
*** Fix browsed URLs not being added to history
Yes, this is better for a daily usage :)

*** Fix crash when proxy-mode was added to the list of default modes
You can now write this to open pages in proxy-mode by default:

#+begin_src lisp
(setf (get-default 'proxy-mode 'server-address) "socks5://localhost:1080")
(add-to-default-list 'proxy-mode 'buffer 'default-modes)
#+end_src

Thanks to @MasterCsquare.

*** More bug fixes (special thanks to Solomon Bloch, @goose121, Sean Farley, @glacambre)
*** Developer changes

**** The Makefile automatically updates the Quicklisp distribution

Next uses its own installation path for the Quicklisp dependencies, it
doesn't mesh with your  existing =~/quicklisp/local-projects=. Now you
can  follow git  master without  the suprise  of a  library missing  a
function.

**** Remove cl-string-match and cl-strings dependencies
Now we mostly rely on [[https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str/issues][str]] and [[https://edicl.github.io/cl-ppcre/][cl-ppcre]].

** DONE 1.3.0
*** DONE PyQt/Webengine platform port
QtWebengine is based off Blink (the renderer of Chrome).
A PyQt platform port would have the benefits of being cross-platform while
offering an alternative web renderer.

Because of WKWebKit library limitations, the cocoa-webkit platform port misses
some features such as proxy support, per-buffer cookie file, network resource
interception.  To address these limitations, the PyQt platform port could become
the default for macOS.
*** DONE VI bindings
*** DONE Ad-blocking support
Only host-based for now and uses Easylist by default.
*** DONE Fix search implementation
It now displays search hints properly and search within iframes too.
*** DONE Add initial download support
*** DONE Support multiple modes per buffer
*** DONE Add proxy-mode
This makes it possible to use Next over Tor among others.
*** DONE Add noscript-mode to disable JavaScript
*** DONE Use D-Bus for inter-process communication
This increases security and should also improve performance, notably on *BSD systems.
*** DONE Remove ~define-parenstatic~ macro
~define-parenscript~ supersedes it.
*** DONE Smarter start up logic
Next will try harder to "do the right thing" when starting.
A simple ~(next:start)~ from the REPL should be enough in most cases.
*** DONE Improve minibuffer fuzzy-matching to support permutations and typos
*** DONE Extended bindings
- C-w copies any candidate
- TAB inserts the candidate in the minibuffer.
- C-v and M-v scroll pages up and down.
- C-x C-k deletes the current buffer.
- C-left, C-right, C-Page_Up and C-Page_Down go to previous/next buffer.
*** DONE Fix init file location guessing
It used to be hard-coded, now it's found in ~/.config/next/init.lisp.
*** DONE Display a help buffer on startup
This does not require an Internet connection.
*** DONE Add Roswell build script (thanks to Danny YUE)
*** DONE Fix the "blank buffer" issue with the gtk-webkit platform port
*** DONE Fix the minibuffer size with the gtk-webkit platform port
*** DONE Display current URL or URL at point in the echo area
*** DONE Add the ~about~ command to display list of campaign backers
*** DONE Rename ~add-search-hints~ to ~search-buffer~
*** DONE Rename ~kill~ to ~quit~
*** DONE Rename ~*anchor*~ commands to ~*hint*~
** DONE 1.2.2
*** Use authenticated RPC to mitigate remote-execution vulnerability
*** Cocoa-webkit support has been dropped
The WKWebKit library is too poor for our use in Next.
Cocoa-webkit will be replaced with a QtWebengine platform port in a coming version.
*** Fix C-[ and C-] bindings with gtk-webkit
*** Allow loading HTML files specified with relative path
*** Properly terminate platform port on SIGTERM
*** Support multiple expressions in command-evaluate
*** Fix ~delete-buffer~ command
*** Properly fall back to default search engine on invalid URI
** DONE 1.2.1
*** DONE Improve =next-gtk-webkit= stability
In particular, removes a race condition that would often hang the browser on key
presses.
*** DONE Make almost everything stateless but *interface*
Most globals are gone.
Everything is properly initialized just-in-time so that it won't fail if the
user forgets to initialize something manually.
~(next:start)~ can safely be run multiple times in a row while producing the
same result.
*** DONE Improve search engine support (thanks to /wednesday/)
Fall back to a search engine query if input is not a URI.
Add support for multiple search engines.
*** DONE Sort history by number of visits (thanks to /wednesday/)
*** DONE Add support for local HTML (file:// protocol)
*** DONE Add experimental proxy support
Due to limitations in the WKWebview API, the Cocoa version lacks proxy
support.
*** DONE Add mouse support
*** DONE Intercept all network events
This makes it possible to implement, for instance, ad-blocking, fully from the
Lisp side.

Due to limitations in the WKWebview API, the Cocoa version lacks the
ability to do any processing on a per URI resource basis. The
consequence of this means no Adblocking, no Downloads.
*** DONE Input events (e.g. key presses, mouse buttons) can be generated programatically
*** DONE Move platform-specific key translation to the platform port
*** DONE Clean up on exit
Catch SIGTERM (C-c in a shell), kill the interface on exit, etc.
*** DONE Don't give up so easily on startup
Next will now try to find free ports automatically.
It will find the platform ports automatically if run from source.
Platform port polling is only done for a limited time to avoid hung processes.
*** DONE Add experimental Clozure Common Lisp (CCL) support
*** DONE Improve logging and error reporting
In particular, some errors are reporting in the echo area.
*** DONE Save platform port log to XDG_DATA_HOME/next/
*** DONE Add experimental support for =next-gtk-webkit= on macOS
Though it works on macOS, WebkitGTK+ is very slow since it does not utilize the
native graphical frameworks/libraries. Users can see our Macports subtree to
install WebkitGTK+ and compile Next manually.
*** DONE Rename ~execute-extended-command~ to ~execute-command~
*** DONE Rename ~reload-init~ to ~load-init-file~
*** DONE Remove ~define-parenstatic~ macro
Both macros are merged into ~define-parenscript~.
*** DONE Rename ~mode~ to ~root-mode~
*** DONE Replace the =-= in XML-RPC method names with =.=
As per the specifications, =-= is not a valid XML-RPC character in method names.
*** DONE Prefix all RPC calls with =%%= in the Lisp core
** DONE 1.2.0
*** DONE Add RELOAD-CURRENT-BUFFER command and bind it to C-r
*** DONE Add NEXT-VERSION command
It reports the commit hash if it was not built on a tag version.
*** DONE Add cookie support
GTK implementation has per-buffer cookie support.

Due to limitations in the WKWebview API, the Cocoa version lacks the
ability to specify a per-buffer or application-wide cookies directory.
*** DONE Report page load status to echo area
*** DONE Add COPY-TITLE command and bind it to M-w
*** DONE Add COPY-ANCHOR-URL command and bind it to C-x C-w
*** DONE Add COPY-URL command and bind it to C-w
*** DONE Add PASTE command to minibuffer and bind it to C-v and C-y
*** DONE Add common movement commands to minibuffer
For instance ~cursor-forwards-word~ is bound to =M-f= by default.
*** DONE Add "echo area" to display status messaages
*** DONE Set window title dynamically
*** DONE Embed/Replace build dependencies in the Cocoa port
It now builds out of the box, with no need for external libraries.
*** DONE Add commandline arguments to the Cocoa platform port
*** DONE Report user configuration errors
*** DONE Save platform logs to /tmp/next-$USER/
** DONE 1.1.0
*** DONE Overhaul start-up and exit processes
*** DONE Add --init-file command line parameter
*** DONE Fix a number of issues with GTK-WebKit
*** DONE Enhance logging with GTK-WebKit
See /tmp/next-webkit-gtk.log by default.
Debug message can be included by exporting the =G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all=
environement variable.

CLOSED: [2017-09-09 Tue 19:05]
This version describes the minimum usability as a basic browser, with
the following features:

- Implementation of document-mode, the major-mode that all modes extend
- Ability to set key bindings for major modes
- Ability to browse and change buffers using C-x b

*** Definitions
Buffer: All documents are contained in an object type called a
buffer. As an example, a document on the web located at
http://www.url.com can be contained in a buffer with a similar name. A
buffer is composed of all elements (text, bitmaps, etc) necessary to
render a single document.

Mode-map: A keyboard hot-key to function mapping.

Minibuffer: A special buffer dedicated to interacting with Next
commands in progress. This buffer appears at the bottom of the screen
and is collapsed when not in use.

Major-mode: A major mode is defined as the primary mode of interacting
with a particular buffer. A mode defines a set of key bindings, hooks
for actions, and presentation details for a given view. At any given
time, there may only be one major mode for a buffer. All major modes
are composed of entirely lower case alpha with dashes used as a
separator. Every major mode has a keyboard mapping that follows this
pattern: document-mode, will have a mode map called document-mode-map.

Minor-mode: A minor mode is a secondary mode of modifying a buffer's
behavior and content. There can be an infinite amount of minor modes
applied to a given buffer. All minor modes are composed of entirely
lower case alpha with dashes used as a separator.

*** DONE Major mode: document-mode
CLOSED: [2017-08-28 Mon 00:29]
All major modes inherit from document mode. Document mode provides the
basic framework for mapping global commands and defining general
behavior.

Document-mode will be the basic major mode for opening documents on
the web. document-mode will extend document-mode, and thus will
inherit all of its key bindings. If there is a conflict of key
bindings, the lowest scope key binding will be prioritized. As a
concrete example, all bindings defined in a minor mode will override
any defined in document-mode. In the first release, document-mode will
support the following key bindings and features:

For the first release, document-mode must have:

**** DONE Ability to open a new html document with the key binding C-l
CLOSED: [2017-08-14 Mon 11:31]
Opening of new pages in the same buffer can be invoked by the key
binding C-l. This key binding will open up the Minibuffer and prompt
the user to enter the url which they would like to visit.
**** DONE Ability to open new buffers with the key-binding M-l
CLOSED: [2017-08-28 Mon 00:28]
Opening of new buffers by invoking M-l will open the Minibuffer.
Within the Minibuffer, the user will be presented with a prompt in
which they can enter in the url they would like to visit in a new
buffer.

- May possibly switch implementation to "hide" rather than "close"
  widgets, possibly using a widget pool as well for memory performance

*** DONE Ability to set Key bindings
CLOSED: [2017-08-12 Sat 16:34]
The following syntax should be used to set a key binding:

(define-key x-mode-map (key "C-h") 'function)

    Where x-mode-map is a keymap relating to a mode (major or minor).

    Where 'function is a function that is passed to define-key to
    trigger a function upon a key press.

(key "C-h") defines that the keyboard sequence Control + h is
represented. For the keyboard syntax, the following keys are
described:

- S = super key (windows/command key)
- C = control key
- M = meta key (alt key)

A chain of key bindings may be set in the following manner:

(key "C-x C-s") will denote the following key presses, Ctrl + x, followed
by Ctrl + s immediately thereafter.

Upon the definition of a "chained" keyboard binding, any elements
in the chain may not be used individually. For example, binding
"C-x C-s", will prohibit the binding of "C-x" by itself. This is
because there would be ambiguity in regards to which key binding
is intended to be invoked.

*** DONE Ability to browse and change buffers
CLOSED: [2017-09-05 Tue 00:58]
The user will be able to invoke the key binding C-x b to bring up
a menu in the Minibuffer in which they will be able to select a new buffer
to bring to focus.
**** DONE Minibuffer Completion
CLOSED: [2017-09-10 Sun 01:42]
Switch buffer should demonstrate an example of minibuffer completion
candidates
*** DONE Compilation OSX
CLOSED: [2017-09-04 Mon 00:09]
- One "click" build system for deployment on OSX
- Organization of build systems into lisp files, no shell scripts
