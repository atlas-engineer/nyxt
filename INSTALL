Usage:

   make all                 Create Nyxt.
   make install             Install Nyxt.

Set DESTDIR to change the target destinatation.  It should be
an absolute path.

Set LISP and LISP_FLAGS to accommodate to your Lisp compiler.

Set NYXT_RENDERER to the renderer of your choice, e.g. "gtk".

Set NYXT_COMPRESS to generate a compressed executable.  This
greatly reduces the file size at the expense of a slightly
increased startup time.  It's recommended to leave this off
on file systems with compression.

If NYXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP is "true" (the default), all Lisp
dependencies will be fetched with Quicklisp into the
QUICKLISP_DIR directory.

Otherwise, the dependencies will have to be locally installed
on your system.  You may have to accomodate the LISP_FLAGS
to, use your local install of Quicklisp.  For example:

make nyxt NYXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false LISP_FLAGS=

WARNING: Make sure your Quicklisp distribution is up-to-date when using
NYXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false.  Also check the .gitmodules file for Common Lisp
libraries that should follow master.
