Usage:

   make next                Create Next.
   make install-next        Install Next.

   make all                 Create Next.
   make install             Install Next.

Set DESTDIR to change the target destinatation.  It should be
an absolute path.

Set LISP and LISP_FLAGS to accommodate to your Lisp compiler.

Set NEXT_RENDERER to the renderer of your choice, e.g. "gtk".

Set NEXT_COMPRESS to generate a compressed executable.  This
greatly reduces the file size at the expense of a slightly
increased startup time.  It's recommended to leave this off
on file systems with compression.

If NEXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP is "true" (the default), all Lisp
dependencies will be fetched with Quicklisp into the
QUICKLISP_DIR directory.

Otherwise, the dependencies will have to be locally installed
on your system.  You may have to accomodate the LISP_FLAGS
to, use your local install of Quicklisp.  For example:

make next NEXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false LISP_FLAGS=
