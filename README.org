* Next Web Browser
Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser inspired by Emacs
and designed for power users. The application has familiar
key-bindings, is fully configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has
powerful features for productive professionals.

* Features
Next includes many features designed to enable you to focus on being
productive. A few of them are demonstrated below.

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, and any other valid series of letters.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

In the example below, the User performs the following actions:

1. Starts page ~True Parrot~
2. Visits page ~Gray Parrot~
3. Returns to page ~True Parrot~
4. Visits page ~Budgerigar~
5. Returns to page ~True Parrot~
6. Executes ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would NOT be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Gray Parrot~. Instead of
erasing your history, Next offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Gray Parrot~ or to
~Budgerigar~?

** Lightning fast navigation
Next is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way,
and everything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on
your task unburdened by cumbersome UI.

Link Hints provide you with the ability to instantly jump to any link
on the page, or even open it in a new tab.

Fuzzy completion means intelligent completion. Find your bookmarks,
open up new links, or switch tabs with the power of fuzzy completion.

** Customize and EXTend Next
Customization is possible through the creation of a

can override and redefine any of the functions by defining your init
file as part of the ~:next~ package. For more information please see:
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org#customization][customizing Next]].

Additionally, a document provided in the documents directory named
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/EXTENSION.org][EXTENSION.org]] is a place for the community to share helpful
customizations. To share your own extension, please make a pull
request with your new extension appended to EXTENSION.org.
