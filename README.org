* Nyxt web browser

Nyxt is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power
users.  It has familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][vi]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]), is fully
configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for
productivity.

If you like Nyxt and if you want to help future development, please

*Attention:* Nyxt is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues][report]]
bugs, instabilities or feature wishes.

** Fast tab switching

Switch easily between your open tabs via fuzzy search.  If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.

** Multiple selection

Commands can accept multiple inputs, allowing you to quickly perform an
operation against multiple objects.  In the example below we search for
penguins, and only open up links that have the text "animal" within
them.

** Powerful bookmarks

Bookmark a page with tags.  Search bookmarks with compound queries.
Capture more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle them in
any way you like.

** Multi tab search

Search multiple tabs at the same time, and view all the results in a
single window.  Jump quickly through your open tabs to find what you
need.

** History as a tree

History is represented as a tree that you can traverse.  Smarter than
the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree
makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.
