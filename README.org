* Next Web Browser
Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power
users. The application has familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][VI]], or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]),
is fully configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful
features for productive professionals.

Next includes many features designed to enable you to be productive. A
few of them are demonstrated below.

*Warning:* Next is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues][report]] bugs,
instabilities or feature wishes.

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, and any other valid series of letters.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

Consider the following example:

1. Start page ~True Parrot~
2. Visit page ~Gray Parrot~
3. Return to page ~True Parrot~
4. Visit page ~Budgerigar~
5. Return to page ~True Parrot~
6. Execute ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would *not* be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Gray Parrot~. Instead of
erasing your history, Next offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Gray Parrot~ or to
~Budgerigar~?

** Lightning fast navigation
Next is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way-
everything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on
your task unburdened by cumbersome UI.

Link Hints provide you with the ability to instantly jump to any link
on the page, or even open it in a new tab.

Fuzzy completion means intelligent completion. Find your bookmarks,
open up new links, or switch tabs with the power of fuzzy completion.

* Getting Started
** Install Next

Next is made of two components: a  _lisp core_ and a so called _platform
port_. In addition, the platform port comes in two flavours:

- Gtk/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit][Webkit]], the browser  engine of the Gnome platform,  also used in
  Apple's Safari
- Qt/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)][Webengine/Blink]], the browser engine of Google Chrome.

We  support *GNU/Linux*,  *MacOS*  and *GuixSD*.   Windows support  is
possible but untested.

The recommended way  is to download a *self-contained  Guix archive*. It
contains the  lisp core,  the Gtk  platform port  and /all  the system
dependencies/. You only have to download and run it !

See the [[https://next.atlas.engineer/download][downloads]] page for pre-built binaries.

In addition, some operating systems provide packages for Next:

- [[https://source.atlas.engineer/view/repository/macports-port][MacPorts]]
- [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/next-browser-git/][Arch Linux AUR]]
- [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix]]: Install  with =guix package --install  sbcl-next=

If you want to use the Qt Webengine/Blink platform port, you currently
have to download it separately.

_Warning_: the Qt platform port is still beta software

- download a  Qt Webengine archive  [[https://next.atlas.engineer/static/release/next-pyqt-webengine.tar.gz][here]]. Once you have  extracted it,
  run  the  =next-pyqt-webengine= binary.
- download a GNU/Linux Debian binary of the lisp core [[https://gitlab.com/atlas-engineer/next/pipelines?scope=all&page=1][on our CI system
  here]] (you  have to download  the build  artifacts), and run  it with
  =./next=. You should see a Next window.

*** About Guix

Guix is a package manager that can be installed on any GNU/Linux distribution;
should Next be missing from your distribution, there is always the possibility
to install Guix on your system and use it to install Next.

- If Guix is easily available for your distribution (e.g. as a
  package), then this is the simplest route.

- If not, or if you want to help developing Next, building from source
  is the recommended route.

To perform an installation from source, please see the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/tree/master/documents][developer readme]].

*** D-Bus Requirement

Since 1.3.0, Next needs a D-Bus session bus to run.
In most cases, it should already be running.

If Next does not start up, it is very likely that D-Bus is not running
for your user.

** Quickstart Keys
- ~C-l~:     Load URL in tab
- ~M-l~:     Load URL in a new tab
- ~C-x b~:   Switch tab
- ~C-b~:     Backwards history
- ~C-f~:     Forwards history
- ~C-x C-c~: Quit

The symbols represent modifiers:

- ~C~: Control key
- ~S~: Super (Windows key, Command key)
- ~M~: Meta (Alt key, Option key)
- ~s~: Shift key

The following keys exist as special keys:

~BACKSPACE~, ~DELETE~, ~ESCAPE~ , ~HYPHEN~, ~RETURN~, ~SPACE~, ~TAB~,
~Left~, ~Right~, ~Up~, ~Down~

** Customize and Extend Next
Customization is possible through the creation of a
=~/.config/next/init.lisp= file. From here you
can override and redefine any of the functions by defining your init
file as part of the ~:next~ package. For more information please see:
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org#customization][customizing Next]].

Additionally, a document provided in the documents directory named
[[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/EXTENSION.org][EXTENSION.org]] is a place for the community to share helpful
customizations. To share your own extension, please make a pull
request with your new extension appended to EXTENSION.org.

** Documentation
For full documentation about Next, how it works, and how to extend it
please see the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org][user manual]].

If you want to help with development or build Next from scratch, read
the developer's documentation at [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/README.org][documents/README.org]].

** History of changes
Please see the [[file:documents/CHANGELOG.org][CHANGELOG.org]].
