* Next web browser

Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power
users. The application has familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][VI]]), is fully
configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for
productive professionals.

*Warning:* Next is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues][report]] bugs,
instabilities or feature wishes.

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. smarter than
the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree
makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

** Lightning fast navigation
Next is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way-
everything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on
your task.

* Getting started
** Install Next

Next supports GNU/Linux, macOS, and Guix with engine support for
WebKit and WebEngine/Blink.

Please see the [[https://next.atlas.engineer/download][downloads]] page for pre-built binaries. Some operating
systems provide packages for Next:

- Debian
- [[https://source.atlas.engineer/view/repository/macports-port][MacPorts]]
- [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/next-browser-git/][Arch Linux AUR]]
- [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]]: Install with =nix-env --install next=.
- [[https://guix.gnu.org][Guix]]: Install with =guix install next=.

To perform an installation from source, please see the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/tree/master/documents][developer readme]].

If you want to use the Qt Webengine/Blink platform port, you currently
have to build it from source.

- Download a Qt Webengine archive [[https://next.atlas.engineer/static/release/next-pyqt-webengine.tar.gz][here]]. Once you have extracted it,
  run the =next-pyqt-webengine= binary.
- Download a GNU/Linux Debian binary of the Lisp core [[https://gitlab.com/atlas-engineer/next/pipelines?scope=all&page=1][on our CI system
  here]] (you have to download the build artifacts), and run it with
  =./next=.

*** D-Bus requirement

Next needs a D-Bus session bus to run. In most cases, it should
already be running. If Next does not start up, it is very likely that
D-Bus is not running for your user.

** Quickstart keys

- ~C-l~:     Load URL in tab
- ~M-l~:     Load URL in a new tab
- ~C-x b~:   Switch tab
- ~C-b~:     Backwards history
- ~C-f~:     Forwards history
- ~C-x C-c~: Quit
- ~TAB~: Complete candidate (in minibuffer)

The symbols represent modifiers:

- ~C~: Control key
- ~S~: Super (Windows key, Command key)
- ~M~: Meta (Alt key, Option key)
- ~s~: Shift key

The following keys exist as special keys:

~BACKSPACE~, ~DELETE~, ~ESCAPE~ , ~HYPHEN~, ~RETURN~, ~SPACE~, ~TAB~,
~Left~, ~Right~, ~Up~, ~Down~

** Configuration
*** Customize and extend Next

Complete customization is possible through the creation of a
=~/.config/next/init.lisp= file. For more information please see:
"Customizing Next" within the [[file:documents/MANUAL.org][MANUAL.org]].

Additionally, a document provided in the documents directory named
[[file:documents/EXTENSION.org][EXTENSION.org]] is a place for the community to share helpful
customizations. To share your own extension, please make a pull
request with your new extension appended to EXTENSION.org.

*** Run Next in a security sandbox

For improved security while you browse the internet, you can run Next
with [[https://firejail.wordpress.com/][Firejail]] on GNU/Linux.

#+begin_quote
Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security breaches
by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using
Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. It allows a process and all its
descendants to have their own private view of the globally shared
kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount
table.
#+end_quote

Run it like this:

: firejail --ignore=nodbus next-gtk-webkit

** Documentation

For full documentation about Next, how it works, and how to extend it
please see the [[file:documents/MANUAL.org][MANUAL.org]].

If you want to help with development or build Next from scratch, read
the developer's documentation at [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/README.org][documents/README.org]].

** History of changes
Please see the [[file:documents/CHANGELOG.org][CHANGELOG.org]].
