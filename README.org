* Next web browser

Next is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power

and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for productive
professionals.

** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. smarter than
the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree
makes sure  you never lose  track of where  you've been.

** Multiple selection
Commands can accept multiple input, allowing you to quickly perform an
operation against multiple tabs.

** Powerful Bookmarks
Bookmark a page with tags. Search bookmarks with compound
queries. Capture more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle
them in any way you like.
