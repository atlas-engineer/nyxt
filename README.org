* Nyxt browser

Nyxt is a keyboard-oriented, infinitely extensible web browser designed
for power users.  Conceptually inspired by Emacs and Vim, it has
familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][vi]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]), and is fully configurable in
Lisp.

If you like Nyxt and you would like to help future development, please
give us a star, spread the word, and support us on [[https://www.patreon.com/nyxt][Patreon]], thank you!

*Attention:* Nyxt is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues][report]]
bugs, instabilities or feature wishes.

** Fast tab switching

Switch easily between your open tabs via fuzzy search.  If you are
looking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.

** Multiple selection

Commands can accept multiple inputs, allowing you to quickly perform an
operation against multiple objects.  In the example below we search for
cactuses, and open up several images simultaneously:

** Powerful bookmarks

Bookmark a page with tags.  Search bookmarks with compound queries.
Capture more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle them in
any way you like.

** Multi tab search

Search multiple tabs at the same time, and view all the results in a
single window.  Jump quickly through your open tabs to find what you
need.

** History as a tree

History is represented as a tree that you can traverse.  Smarter than
the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree
makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.
