* Nyxt browser

*Nyxt* [n√Ωkst] is a keyboard-driven web browser designed for hackers.  Inspired by
Emacs and Vim, it has familiar keybindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][vi]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]), and is infinitely
extensible in Lisp.

*Attention:* Nyxt is under active development.  Please feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues][report]] bugs,
instabilities or feature wishes.

* Features
For an exhaustive description of all of the features, please refer to the
manual.

** Fast tab switching

Switch easily between your open tabs via fuzzy search.  If you are looking for
~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~, ~epl~, or any other
matching series of letters.

** Multiple marking

Commands can accept multiple inputs, allowing you to quickly perform an
operation against multiple objects.  In the example below we simultaneously open
several bookmarks.

** Powerful bookmarks

Bookmark a page with tags.  Search bookmarks with compound queries.  Capture
more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle them in any way you like.

** Multi tab search

Search multiple tabs at the same time, and view all the results in a single
window.  Jump quickly through your open tabs to find what you need.

** History as a tree

History is represented as a tree that you can traverse.  Smarter than the
"forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree makes sure
you never lose track of where you've been.
