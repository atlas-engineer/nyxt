* Nyxt browser

*Nyxt* [n√Ωkst] is a keyboard-driven web browser designed for power users.  Inspired by
Emacs and Vim, it has familiar keybindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][vi]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access][CUA]]), and is infinitely
extensible in Lisp.

If you like Nyxt and you would like to help future development, please give us a
star, spread the word, and support us on [[https://www.patreon.com/nyxt][Patreon]], thank you!

*Attention:* Nyxt is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues][report]] bugs,
instabilities or feature wishes.

* Features
For an exhaustive description of all of the features, please refer to the
manual.

** Fast tab switching

Switch easily between your open tabs via fuzzy search.  If you are looking for
~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~, ~epl~, or any other
matching series of letters.

** Multiple marking

Commands can accept multiple inputs, allowing you to quickly perform an
operation against multiple objects.  In the example below we search for
cactuses, and open up several images simultaneously:

** Powerful bookmarks

Bookmark a page with tags.  Search bookmarks with compound queries.  Capture
more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle them in any way you like.

** Multi tab search

Search multiple tabs at the same time, and view all the results in a single
window.  Jump quickly through your open tabs to find what you need.

** History as a tree

History is represented as a tree that you can traverse.  Smarter than the
"forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree makes sure
you never lose track of where you've been.
